# MazeGame
This is a trivia game where every correct answer leads the user closer to finishing the maze. If they get a question wrong they are lead away from finishing the maze. They are not alerted if they got the question right or wrong otherwise.

The plan for the game is to a have a 2d minimap with possible a first person 3d perspective.

The questions are intended to be included in the build with a plist file, but that might change.
